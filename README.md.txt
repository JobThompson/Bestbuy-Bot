#READ ME:

#There are a few pre-requisites for this script.

-You must have a valid bestbuy account. 
It will prompt for the required information upon script execution.

-You must have a valid debit or credit card attached to the bestbuy account
as a primary payment method.

-YOU MUST HAVE FIREFOX INSTALLED. THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH CHROME.

- You need to have pycharm and python 3 installed.
I know, its a pain in the ass, but the program doesnt like being put in an EXE file.
The links for the 2 program requirements are below:
Pycharm Community: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Open GUI.py in pycharm, and in the Terminal tab at the bottom,
input the following commands:

py -m pip install helium
py -m pip install PySimpleGUI

This will install the library needed to run the script. Once thats installed,
right click on the tab at the top of the coding window and click run.

###NOTE:
It may prompt you to choose a interpretor.
if it does so, select the python version that you installed, then run the
commands above in the terminal tab. Then attempt to run the script. 
You should only have to do this once per computer, after that it 
should automatically default to the enviroment.
