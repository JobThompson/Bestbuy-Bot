This program has the ability to store credentials in the Default Credentials file, so you wont need
 to enter them every time. You do not however need to have defaults setup to use the program. 
If it detects no credentials in memory, it will prompt for them. If your item is not listed, enter the 
URL for the product in the Custom URL menu.
The program will only buy 1 product at a time. If you need more than that, you will need to run it several times.
To exit the program after firefox has launched, you can close either the firefox window or the terminal window.
